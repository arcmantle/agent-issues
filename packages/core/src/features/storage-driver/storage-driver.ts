/**
 * The engine-agnostic boundary the domain layer talks to (ADR11, ADR13):
 * SQLite (`SqliteStore`) implements it today, an HTTP-backed cloud client
 * implements it later, and callers never branch on which one they hold.
 * Every operation is async because the cloud path is inherently async.
 *
 * Composed from the three per-feature interfaces (ADR "Backends mirror one
 * another per feature, behind all-async feature interfaces") plus the
 * methods that don't belong to exactly one feature: `tenantId` and tenant
 * administration are cross-cutting, and `getHistoryDiagnostics` spans
 * `SynchronizeStore` and the fourth feature, history diagnostics (which has
 * no public seam of its own - see `HistoryDiagnosticsStore`'s doc comment).
