# Good and Bad Tests

## Good tests

Integration-style tests go through real interfaces instead of mocks of internal parts.

```typescript
test("user can checkout with valid cart", async () => {
  const cart = createCart();
  cart.add(product);
  const result = await checkout(cart, paymentMethod);
  expect(result.status).toBe("confirmed");
});
```

Characteristics:

- Tests behavior users or callers care about.
- Uses public API only.
- Survives internal refactors.
- Describes what, not how.
- Has one logical assertion per test.

## Bad tests

Implementation-detail tests are coupled to internal structure.

```typescript
test("checkout calls paymentService.process", async () => {
  const mockPayment = jest.mock(paymentService);
  await checkout(cart, payment);
  expect(mockPayment.process).toHaveBeenCalledWith(cart.total);
});
```

Red flags:

- Mocking internal collaborators.
- Testing private methods.
- Asserting on call counts or order.
- Breaking on refactor without a behavior change.
- Test names that describe how rather than what.
- Verifying through external means instead of the interface.

```typescript
test("createUser saves to database", async () => {
  await createUser({ name: "Alice" });
  const row = await db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?", ["Alice"]);
  expect(row).toBeDefined();
});

test("createUser makes user retrievable", async () => {
  const user = await createUser({ name: "Alice" });
  const retrieved = await getUser(user.id);
  expect(retrieved.name).toBe("Alice");
});
```
